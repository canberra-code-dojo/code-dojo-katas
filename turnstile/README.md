# Turnstile kata

The objective of this kata is to create a simple program that models a coin-operated turnstile.

* The turnstile has two states: locked and unlocked.
* In the locked state inserting a coin will move it to the unlocked state.
* In the unlocked state pushing lets the person through and returns the stile to the locked state.

Implement this using TDD before moving on to the [second part](README_2nd.md).
