# Data Munge
This is a simple kata involving the reading of data from files and the finding of aggregate data from those files.

## Second exercise

Once this is complete, there is another, similar, problem to solve. You have football scores data from the FA Premier League 2001/2 in [this file](./football.dat), each line contains the team name, the number of matches played, won, lost and drawn, together with the number of goals scored For and Against the team, and also the number of points awarded during the season and some notes on whether the team was promoted or relegated at the end of the season.

The goal (no pun intended) is to find the team that had the minimum spread between goals for and goals against during the season.

Write new tests and code. You may copy and paste.
