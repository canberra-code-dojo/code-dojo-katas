# Data Munge
This is a simple kata involving the reading of data from files and the finding of aggregate data from those files.

The original idea for this kata is from Dave Thomas and you can find his write up from 2007 [here](http://codekata.com/kata/kata04-data-munging/).

## First exercise

In the first example we have a [data file](./weather.dat) from a weather station at Heathrow airport. It contains year and month, together with the max and min recorded temperature in degrees Celcius, together with rainfall, sunshine hours and other data that we will not concern ourselves with in this excercise.

The challenge is simple: find the year and month that has the smallest spread between the maximum and minimum temperature recorded for that month.
