# Data Munge
This is a simple kata involving the reading of data from files and the finding of aggregate data from those files.

## Retrospective

Consider:

- Is the resulting code more or less readable than the originals?
- Did the design of the second programme change from the first? If so how, and why?
- How did the original design decisions made in the first two programmes affect the refactoring?
- Which version do you prefer, and why?
- Looking back, what tradeoffs did you make, and would you make them again?
